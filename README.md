# Cloud Reading Platform - Technical Interview

This project demonstrates my implementation of a basic cloud reading platform, created as part of a technical interview. The solution follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using raw JavaScript.

## Features
- **User Library Management**: Users can add and remove books from their personal library.
- **Active Book Setting**: Users can select a book from their library and set it as the active book.
- **Bookmarking**: The system remembers the last page a user was reading.
- **Single Page Display**: Displays one page of the active book at a time for better focus and readability.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6)
- **Design**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Testing
Testing was performed manually to ensure proper functionality, focusing on user interactions, state management, and navigation between pages.
